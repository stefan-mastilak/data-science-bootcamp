Machine learning & Data science Bootcamp
----------------------------------------

How we will proceed:
--------------------
1) Create a framework
    * general framework based on the above schema
2) Match to data science and machine learning tools
    * there are existing tools for variety of problems
3) Learn by doing
    * create a projects to build portfolio of the skills and tools
   

General idea for machine learning framework:
--------------------------------------------
1) Problem definition
   * supervised or unsupervised learning?
   * classification or regression problem?
   
2) Data
   * data is requirement for any ML project
   * what kind of data we have? 
        - structured? (spreadsheet, database, etc.)
        - unstructured? (images, audio, etc.)
   
3) Evaluation
   * define what success means for us
   * evaluation metrics
   
4) Features
   * what do we already know about the data?
   * numerical or categorical data
   
5) Modeling
   * what model should we used based on the problem and data that we have?

6) Experiments
   * how could we improve?
   * what can we try next?
