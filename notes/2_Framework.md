Machine learning & Data science Bootcamp
----------------------------------------

How we will proceed:
--------------------
1) Create a framework
    * general framework based on the above schema
   

2) Match to data science and machine learning tools
    * there are existing tools for variety of problems
   

3) Learn by doing
    * create a projects to build portfolio of the skills and tools
   

General idea for machine learning framework:
--------------------------------------------

1) Problem definition
   * supervised or unsupervised learning?
   * classification or regression problem?
   

2) Data
   * data is requirement for any ML project
   * what kind of data we have? 
        - structured? (spreadsheet, database, etc.)
        - unstructured? (images, audio, etc.)
   

3) Evaluation
   * define what success means for us
   * evaluation metrics
   

4) Features
   * what do we already know about the data?
   * numerical or categorical data
   

5) Modeling
   * what model should we used based on the problem and data that we have?


6) Experiments
   * how could we improve?
   * what can we try next?

Types of machine learning problems:
-----------------------------------

### Supervised learning
   * you have data and labels
   * algorithm tries to use data to predict labels
   * if it guesses a label wrong, algorithm corrects itself and tries again 
   * this active correction is why it's called supervised
   
   #### Classification problem
   Problem - Is this example one thing or another?

   * Binary classification - two options (Does patient have heart disease?)
   * Multi-class classification - more than two options (What type of breed is this dog?)

   #### Regression problem
   Problem - How much will this house sell for? Or How many people will buy this app?

   * In general, we're trying to predict a number here
   * like number of days, money, clicks etc.


### Unsupervised learning
   * Data with no labels
### Transfer learning
### Reinforcement learning
