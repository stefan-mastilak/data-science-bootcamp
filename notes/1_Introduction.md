Machine learning:
-----------------
- ML is using algorithm to learn different patterns in data to predict results for similar data coming into the algorithm
- ML lets computers to make decisions about the data
- ML lets computers to learn from data, and they make predictions and decisions
- ML algorithms are usually called a models
- ML algorithm finds patterns in data to solve future problems

Machine learning types:
-----------------------

1) Supervised learning
   * labeled data - known inputs and outputs
   * Classification (example: decide if this is pear or apple)
   * Regression (example: predicting stock prices)


2) Unsupervised learning
    * unlabeled data - known inputs
    * Clustering (process of creating groups by finding patterns in data)
    * Association rule learning


3) Transfer learning
   * learning from existing model


4) Reinforcement learning
    * learning trough trials (example: chess play algorithm)
    * Skill acquisition
    * Real time learning
