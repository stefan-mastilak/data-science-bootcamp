Data:
-----
- most essential and difficult thing is the data collection
- goal is to turn data from use-less to use-full state

a) structured - sql db (mssql)
b) unstructured - nosql db (mongoDB)


Machine learning:
-----------------
- ML is using algorithm to lear different patterns in data to predict results for similar data coming into the algorithm
- ML lets computers to make decisions about the data
- ML lets computers to learn from data, and they make predictions and decisions
- ML algorithms are usually called a models
- ML algorithm finds patterns in data to solve future problems


Machine learning types:
-----------------------

1) Supervised learning
        - data already have categories, they are labeled
    a) Classification (example: decide if this is pear or apple)
    b) Regression (example: predicting stock prises)

2) Unsupervised learning
        - data doesn't have labels or groups
    a) Clustering (creating groups)
    b) Association rule learning

3) Reinforcement
        - teaching machines trough trials
        - example: program will learn how to play game by playing it a million times
    a) Skill acquisition
    b) Real time learning
