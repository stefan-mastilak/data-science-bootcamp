## Scikit-learn

* python ML library built on Numpy and Matplotlib
* it has many in-built ML models
* it has methods to evaulate your ML models
* it has very well designed API

### What we're going to cover:

0) End-to-end Scikit-learn workflow
1) Getting data ready
2) Choose the right estimator/algorythm for our problems
3) Fit the model/algoryth and use it to make predictions on our data
4) Evaulating model
5) Improve model
6) Save and load a trained model
7) Putting it all together
